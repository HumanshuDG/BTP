        In this project, the aim is to build a Machine Learning-based model for the short-term forecasting of orange and cotton crop prices in the context of an Indian market. For this purpose, we will use the existing dataset available at Indian Government. We start by performing the exploratory data analysis(EDA) to take care of missing data and to identify the patterns. Later, we will split the data records to training, testing and validation set. We will use regression based candidate algorithms for this forecasting. Specifically, ANN (Artificial Neural Network), ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average), LR (Logistic Regression) and SVR (Support Vector Regression) will be used. To compare the results, we will also implement the ARIMA model. We are performing this time series analysis based on regional and seasonal aspects. We consider regional aspects by dividing dataset in tiers of urban and rural cities. We will compare the results and accuracy of machine learning models at different geographic levels, such as country, state, and particular cities.}
