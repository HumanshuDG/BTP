\section{Aim and Objectives}

\subsection{Aim}
    To devise a Machine Learning based short-term forecasting mechanism of orange and cotton crop prices in context of Indian market.

\subsection{Objectives}
    The objective of this project is to create a machine learning-driven model for predicting the prices of orange and cotton crops within the Indian market.
    % The model should be able:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item
            Perform exploratory data analysis to address missing data in the dataset.
        \item
            Identify patterns within the data, if any, that can inform the price prediction model.
        \item
            Devise a method to determine the appropriate number of data records for training the model.
        \item
            Explore various training and learning algorithms to identify the most suitable ones for the task.
        \item
            Test and validate the model to ensure its accuracy and reliability.
        \item
            Tuning the hyperparameters of the best performing model.
        \item
            Build a machine learning-based model for predicting the prices of orange and cotton crops in the Indian market.
