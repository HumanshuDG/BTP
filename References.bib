    abstract = {Machine learning (ML) methods are gaining popularity in the forecasting field, as they have shown strong empirical performance in the recent M4 and M5 competitions, as well as in several Kaggle competitions. However, understanding why and how these methods work well for forecasting is still at a very early stage, partly due to their complexity. In this paper, I present a framework for regression-based ML that provides researchers with a common language and abstraction to aid in their study. To demonstrate the utility of the framework, I show how it can be used to map and compare ML methods used in the M5 Uncertainty competition. I then describe how the framework can be used together with ablation testing to systematically study their performance. Lastly, I use the framework to provide an overview of the solution space in regression-based ML forecasting, identifying areas for further research.}

The forecasting domain has been influenced, from the 1960s on, by linear statistical methods such as ARIMA models. More recently, machine learning models have drawn attention and have established themselves as serious contenders to classical statistical models in the forecasting community. This chapter presents an overview of machine learning techniques in time series forecasting by focusing on three aspects: the formalization of one-step forecasting problems as supervised learning tasks, the discussion of local learning techniques as an effective tool for dealing with temporal data and the role of the forecasting strategy when we move from one-step to multiple-step forecasting.",

    abstract = {For time series prediction tasks, the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model is one of the most classical and popular linear models, and extended applications have achieved satisfying prediction accuracy in many domains. However, less work has focused on the influence of noisy data, which causes the instability of ARIMA and a sharp decline in performance. In this paper, we propose a robust time series prediction framework named spARIMA. To reduce noise interference in the training process, we design a sequential training scheme in batches based on the degree of noise and the contribution to the correct modeling. spARIMA relies on the differential prediction model in ARIMA and absorbs the advantages of the gradual training scheme in self-paced learning (SPL) so that spARIMA can effectively address the instability caused by noise. Moreover, considering that the similarity of selected samples may generate local optimal solutions, we extend spARIMA to diversity selection, which utilizes a weighted local complexity–similarity distance expression to represent the diversity of noisy data. We test the performance of spARIMA on twelve datasets compared with existing ARIMA models on two gradient descent algorithms. The results show that our method is not only suitable for noisy data but also efficient for normal data, which indicates the generalization ability of spARIMA.}

The dynamic behavior of most of the time series in our real life with its autoregressive and inherited moving average terms issue the challenge to forecast nonlinear times series that contain inherited moving average terms using computational intelligence methodologies such as neural networks. It is rare to find studies that concentrate on forecasting nonlinear times series that contain moving average terms. In this study, we demonstrate that the common neural networks are not efficient for recognizing the behavior of nonlinear or dynamic time series which has moving average terms and hence low forecasting capability. This leads to the importance of formulating new models of neural networks such as Deep Learning neural networks with or without hybrid methodologies such as Fuzzy Logic.}

In order to optimize the QR-RBF neural network model parameters, a hybrid algorithm known as GDGA, based on a combination of the genetic algorithm (performing a global search) and a gradient descent method (performing a local search), is proposed in this paper. Data regarding the monthly domestic soybean price in China were analyzed and the results indicate that the proposed hybrid GDGA is effective. Furthermore, the results suggest that the influencing factors of soybean price vary at different price levels. Money supply and port distribution price of imported soybean were found to be important across a range of quantiles; output of domestic soybean and consumer confidence index were important only for low quantiles; and import volume of soybean and consumer price index were important only for high quantiles.}

In recent years farmers in Kerala are shifting from arecanut cultivation to other crops because of price fluctuations and climate change. In this work, the monthly prices of arecanut in Kerala are predicted using time-series and machine learning models.

The aim of this paper is to predict within field variation in wheat yield, based on on-line multi-layer soil data, and satellite imagery crop growth characteristics. Supervised self-organizing maps capable of handling existent information from different soil and crop sensors by utilizing an unsupervised learning algorithm were used. The performance of counter-propagation artificial neural networks (CP-ANNs), XY-fused Networks (XY-Fs) and Supervised Kohonen Networks (SKNs) for predicting wheat yield in a 22ha field in Bedfordshire, UK were compared for a single cropping season. The self organizing models consisted of input nodes corresponded to feature vectors formed from normalized values of on-line predicted soil parameters and the satellite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The output nodes consisted of yield isofrequency classes, which were predicted from the three trained networks. Results showed that cross validation based yield prediction of the SKN model for the low yield class exceeded 91% which can be considered as highly accurate given the complex relationship between limiting factors and the yield. The medium and high yield class reached 70% and 83% respectively. The average overall accuracy for SKN was 81.65%, for CP-ANN 78.3% and for XY-F 80.92%, showing that the SKN model had the best overall performance.}

This paper aims to capture the dynamic volatility of tea crop prices, one of the region's most important cash crops. We applied the Markov-switching GARCH (MS-GARCH)-type specifications with different scedastic functions and error distributions to estimate volatility and forecast the in-sample value-at-risk (VaR) of tea price returns. This paper analyses monthly tea auction prices (i.e., Mombasa auction) in USD from January 1980 to June 2022. The parameters of the MS-GARCH model are estimated in a Bayesian framework via the MCMC approach. The findings evidenced that the EGARCH skewed Student-t model with three regimes was superior in estimating volatility. In terms of VaR evaluation, there is no superior method, but considering scedastic functions, fat tails, asymmetry, and regime switching is more effective. To manage volatility and risk in the East African tea sector, investors should consider regime switching GARCH models.}

A conservative forecast is consistent with cumulative knowledge about the present and the past. To be conservative, forecasters must seek all knowledge relevant to the problem, and use methods that have been validated for the situation. A checklist of 28 guidelines is provided to implement the Golden Rule. This article’s review of research found 150 experimental comparisons; all supported the guidelines. The average error reduction from following a single guideline (compared to common practice) was 28 percent. The Golden Rule Checklist helps forecasters to forecast more accurately, especially when the situation is uncertain and complex, and when bias is likely. Non-experts who know the Golden Rule can identify dubious forecasts quickly and inexpensively. To date, ignorance of research findings, bias, sophisticated statistical procedures, and the proliferation of big data have led forecasters to violate the Golden Rule. As a result, despite major advances in forecasting methods, evidence that forecasting practice has improved over the past half-century is lacking.},

Researchers used statistical inference for discovering the relationships of data to build predictive model. However, crop production and its price trend do not only depend on ecosystems, molecular biology, precision agriculture, veterinary science, animal genes, and technology, but also depend on the environmental change and economic factors. Most importantly, the crop price trend is in non-stationary pattern and is influenced by multiple dimensional factors that the traditional techniques of time series forecasting, such as ARIMA, cannot perform well in prediction. Since CNN model can cope with non-stationary data and learn non-linearity by adjusting the model parameters, it can overcome the limitations of the traditional statistical methods in prediction. Therefore, the aims of this research are to conduct a review to identify a more complete factors that may influence crop production and price changes, and to propose a novel Clustered 3D-CNN model for predicting crop future price. The experiments to compare the performance of our proposed model and ARIMA model were done. The average results found that our proposed Clustered 3D-CNN model (MAPE = 0.083, RMSE = 40.39, MAE = 32.31) outperforms the ARIMA model (MAPE = 0.108, RMSE = 59.95, MAE = 46.35).

Estimation of sugarcane yield and prices are performed in order to make a profitable decision prior to the cultivation of the crop. The machine learning algorithms Decision Tree Regressor, Multi Linear Regression, Random Forest, Adaboost Regressor, Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) Regression, are used to forecast yield of the sugarcane crop. The ARIMA model is used to forecast the sugarcane crop's price. Forecasting sugarcane yield is depending on the parameters like previous sugarcane yield in particular area, rainfall, state where sugarcane is cultivated. Sugarcane price is forecasted based on time series analysis of previous history of prices.},

    abstract={Agriculture is the Backbone of India. India has major portion of cultivational Land. Many Crops have lot of demand in abroad. India is one of the major exporters of Food products other than software. But due to erratic climatic conditions, lack of human Resource and improper decision making in choosing crops, farmers are not able to make profits. Also due to urbanization, Agriculture Profession is losing its importance slowly. This problem has invited many Researchers to identify the issues and apply several Machine Learning approaches like Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Decision trees, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) etc. for accurate Yield and Crop Price Prediction. This helps the Farmers to select suitable crops and obtain maximum yield and Profit.},

    abstract={The majority of food commodities in Nigeria have seen persistent price instability. this is brought by elements like insecurity/insurgency, poor storage facilities, seasonal price changes, inconsistent government policies, COVID-19 containment measures, poor access to credit, technical inputs, lack of modern farm tools and implements. This study focused on comparing the prices of four different food items - beans, onion, tomato, and yam using the ARIMA model to forecast future prices. Two out of the six geopolitical zones of Nigeria were used for the study; the North-Central and North-West. The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) provided the raw data between 2017 and 2018, and the items were weighed in kilograms (Kg). The data was extrapolated into a time series data by executing in R Studio. The stationarity of the series data was obtained by a Unit root Test using the KPSS test (If p<0.05 means the time series is stationary). Results from the forecasted values indicated that food commodities' prices increase with time, making ARIMA a good model for forecasting prices. It was recommended that necessary measures should be put in place to ameliorate the high cost of food prices being experienced in the country of Nigeria.},

    abstract = {Accurate interval forecasting of agricultural commodity futures prices over future horizons is challenging and of great interests to governments and investors, by providing a range of values rather than a point estimate. Following the well-established “linear and nonlinear” modeling framework, this study extends it to forecast interval-valued agricultural commodity futures prices with vector error correction model (VECM) and multi-output support vector regression (MSVR) (abbreviated as VECM–MSVR), which is capable of capturing the linear and nonlinear patterns exhibited in agricultural commodity futures prices. Two agricultural commodity futures prices from Chinese futures market are used to justify the performance of the proposed VECM–MSVR method against selected competitors. The quantitative and comprehensive assessments are performed and the results indicate that the proposed VECM–MSVR method is a promising alternative for forecasting interval-valued agricultural commodity futures prices.}

    abstract = {Abstract A recently developed testing procedure is used to detect and date-stamp explosive episodes (“bubbles”) in corn, soybean, and wheat futures markets during 2004–2013. We find that the markets experienced price explosiveness only approximately two percent of the time and, when bubbles do occur, they are generally short-lived and small in magnitude. The correspondence between observed price spikes and bubbles is rather low, with a large portion of the price explosiveness occurring during downward price movements. Commodity index trader positions do not significantly affect the probability of a positive bubble occurring in grain futures markets, which directly contradicts the argument (the “Masters Hypothesis”) that waves of index investment distorted underlying supply-and-demand relationships and led to a series of massive bubbles in agricultural futures markets. In addition, commodity index trader positions tend to reduce negative bubble occurrence, while general speculative activity as measured by Working's T reduces the probability of a positive bubble. There is some evidence that the positions of noncommercial traders have a direct effect on positive bubble occurrence, but the effect declines when accounting for the composition of other traders in the market. Overall, speculation has little effect or negative effects on price explosiveness. Finally, positive bubbles are more likely to occur in the presence of low inventories, strong exports, a weak U.S. dollar, and booming economic growth, whereas negative bubbles are more likely to occur with large inventories, weak exports, and stagnant economic growth.},

abstract={Because of global climate change, lack of arable land, and rapid population growth, the supplies of three major food crops (i.e., rice, wheat, and corn) have been gradually decreasing worldwide. The rapid increase in demand for food has contributed to a continuous rise in food prices, which directly threatens the lives of over 800 million people around the world who are reported to be chronically undernourished. Consequently, food crop price prediction has attracted considerable attention in recent years. Recent integrated forecasting models have developed various feature selection methods (FSMs) to capture fewer, but more important, explanatory variables. However, one major problem is that the future values of these important explanatory variables are not available. Thus, predictions based on these variables are not actually possible. Because an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) can extract important self-predictor variables with future values that can be calculated, this study incorporates an ARIMA as the FSM for computational intelligence (CI) models to predict three major food crop (i.e., rice, wheat, and corn) prices. Other than the ARIMA, the components of the proposed integrated forecasting models include artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector regression (SVR), and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). The predictive accuracies of ARIMA, ANN, SVR, MARS, and the proposed integrated model are compared and discussed. Experimental results reveal that the proposed integrated model achieves superior forecasting performance for predicting food crop prices.},
