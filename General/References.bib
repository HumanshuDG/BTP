abstract = {In an effort to reduce the impact of vehicular emissions on air quality, India has set Bharat Stage (BS) emission standards since 2000 and the country has now shifted to BS-VI norms from April 2020 onwards. In the present work, the impacts of different stages of BS emission standards in controlling the pollutant emissions are analyzed. The results show that the CO, NMVOC, OC and BC emissions have reduced by 7%, 9.7%, 20% and 5% respectively in 2021, when compared to 2017. Despite the stringent emission norms throughout the years, the NOx emission levels have increased by 4.9% in 2021 with reference to 2017. The NOx emissions show a positive correlation with vehicular population under BS-VI norms. The findings indicate that though the advanced emission control measures are expected to effectively reduce the emissions, it comes out with the penalty of emitting new pollutant species and increase in NOx levels. Thus it calls for the integration of different emission control technologies in a balanced way, which is not reflected in the current policy scenarios.}

abstract = {Machine learning (ML) methods are gaining popularity in the forecasting field, as they have shown strong empirical performance in the recent M4 and M5 competitions, as well as in several Kaggle competitions. However, understanding why and how these methods work well for forecasting is still at a very early stage, partly due to their complexity. In this paper, I present a framework for regression-based ML that provides researchers with a common language and abstraction to aid in their study. To demonstrate the utility of the framework, I show how it can be used to map and compare ML methods used in the M5 Uncertainty competition. I then describe how the framework can be used together with ablation testing to systematically study their performance. Lastly, I use the framework to provide an overview of the solution space in regression-based ML forecasting, identifying areas for further research.}
